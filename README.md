# Profiteer

A comprehensive personal finance management Android application built with modern Android development practices. Profiteer provides a sophisticated dual-wallet system for managing both physical and logical financial accounts with full multi-currency support and real-time synchronization.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Profiteer follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern with the Repository pattern for data abstraction. The application is built using:

- **Frontend**: Android (Kotlin) with Jetpack Compose
- **Backend**: Firebase Authentication + Firestore Database (Native Mode)
- **UI Framework**: Material 3 Design System
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **State Management**: StateFlow and Compose State
- **Reactive Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow

## ✨ Key Features

- **OAuth Integration**: Secure Google Sign-In integration with minimal permissions (Sheets API only)

### 🔍 Balance Discrepancy Debugging
- **Automatic Discrepancy Detection**: Real-time monitoring of Physical vs Logical wallet balance integrity
- **Discrepancy Indicator**: Visual warning card appears in Logical Wallet List when discrepancy detected
- **Debug Screen**: Comprehensive discrepancy analysis showing:
  - Current discrepancy amount and affected totals
  - Chronological transaction list with running balances
  - First problematic transaction highlighted
  - Transaction-by-transaction balance tracking to identify where discrepancy occurred
- **Test-Driven Implementation**: 85+ tests ensuring accuracy and reliability
- **Integrated Logging**: Complete audit trail for debugging and troubleshooting

### 🔐 Security & Data Management
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure Google Sign-In integration
- **User Data Isolation**: Complete data separation with Firestore subcollections
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Live data updates across all devices
- **Firestore Native Mode**: Optimized for real-time listeners and performance

## 🎯 Core Domain Model

### Wallet System Architecture
The application implements a sophisticated dual-wallet system:

**Physical Wallets**
- Represent real-world financial accounts
- Independent entities with their own balance and currency
- Direct transaction impacts and balance tracking

**Logical Wallets**  
- Virtual categorizations built on top of physical wallets
- Used for budgeting and allocation (e.g., "Monthly Expenses", "Emergency Fund")
- **Critical Constraint**: Sum of logical wallet balances must equal sum of physical wallet balances

### Transaction Types
1. **Income Transactions**: Add money to wallets (salary, deposits)
2. **Expense Transactions**: Remove money from wallets (purchases, bills)  
3. **Transfer Transactions**: Move money between wallets (same currency required)

### Multi-Currency Architecture
- Each wallet operates in its native currency
- User-configurable default currency for display purposes
- Conversion rates support both permanent and monthly-specific rates
- Smart fallback system: Default → Monthly when rates are missing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio with Kotlin support
- Firebase account for backend services
- **Target SDK**: 36, **Min SDK**: 24
- **Java Compatibility**: Java 11
- Git for version control

### Firebase Setup Requirements

**Critical Setup Steps**:
1. Create Firebase project in **Native Mode** (not Datastore Mode)
2. Enable Authentication with Google Sign-in provider
3. Create Firestore database in Native Mode with appropriate security rules
4. Configure SHA-1 fingerprints for Google Sign-in in Firebase Console
5. Download `google-services.json` and place in `app/` directory
6. Configure Web Client ID in `AuthRepository.kt` if needed

**Security Rules**: Ensure Firestore security rules enforce user data isolation:
```javascript
allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
```

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Profiteer

# Add your Firebase configuration
# Place google-services.json in app/ directory

# Build and run
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug

# Optional: Run tests to ensure everything is working
./gradlew test
./gradlew lint
```
