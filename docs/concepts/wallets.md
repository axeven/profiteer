# Profiteer Wallet System Documentation

## Overview

Profiteer implements a sophisticated dual-wallet system that separates real-world financial accounts from virtual budget allocations. This approach enables users to track both their actual financial assets and their budgeting strategies without compromising the integrity of their financial data.

## Wallet Architecture

### Wallet Types

**Physical Wallets**
Physical wallets represent tangible financial accounts and assets that exist in the real world. These form the foundation of all financial operations within Profiteer.

**Examples**:
- Bank accounts (checking, savings, money market)
- Cash wallets (physical currency holdings)
- Investment accounts (stocks, bonds, retirement funds)
- Cryptocurrency wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum holdings)
- Credit cards (representing available credit limits)
- Precious metal holdings (physical gold, silver)

**Characteristics**:
- Have actual monetary value that can be verified externally
- Can receive and send real-world transactions
- Each operates in its native currency (USD, EUR, IDR, BTC, GOLD, etc.)
- Independent balance tracking with real-time updates
- Form the authoritative source of truth for total wealth

**Logical Wallets**
Logical wallets are virtual categorizations created for budgeting, allocation, and financial planning purposes. They represent intended uses for money rather than actual financial accounts.

**Examples**:
- Monthly expense allocation (budgeted amount for regular spending)
- Emergency fund allocation (money reserved for unexpected events)
- Vacation savings (funds designated for travel)
- Investment fund (money earmarked for future investments)
- Holiday shopping budget (seasonal spending allocation)

**Characteristics**:
- Virtual allocations without direct real-world counterparts
- Enable sophisticated budgeting and financial planning
- Derive their value from underlying physical wallet funds
- Cannot exceed total physical wallet amounts (critical business rule)
- Allow for unallocated balance tracking

## Wallet Properties

### Core Properties
Each wallet maintains the following essential attributes:

**Identification & Categorization**:
- **Name**: Unique identifier within user account (e.g., "DBS Checking Account", "Emergency Fund")
- **Wallet Type**: Classification as "Physical" or "Logical"
- **Physical Form**: Enum value (FIAT_CURRENCY, PRECIOUS_METAL, CRYPTOCURRENCY)
- **Currency**: Native currency code corresponding to the physical form

**Financial Data**:
- **Current Balance**: Total current balance including all changes
- **Initial Balance**: Starting balance from wallet creation (excluded from analytics)
- **Transaction Balance**: Computed as (Current Balance - Initial Balance) for analytics

**Metadata**:
- **Creation Date**: Timestamp of wallet creation
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of most recent balance or detail modification
- **User ID**: Reference to owning user account

### Balance Calculation System

**Current Balance Components**:
```
Current Balance = Initial Balance + Sum(Income Transactions) - Sum(Expense Transactions) Â± Sum(Transfer Transactions)
```

**Transaction Balance (Analytics)**:
```
Transaction Balance = Current Balance - Initial Balance
```

The transaction balance represents the net change from actual financial activity, excluding the initial setup amount. This separation enables accurate financial analytics that focus on user behavior rather than starting wealth.

## Business Rules & Constraints

### Balance Integrity System

**Primary Constraint**: 
The sum of all logical wallet balances must equal the sum of all physical wallet balances at all times.

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
Sum(Physical Wallet Balances) = Sum(Logical Wallet Balances) + Unallocated Balance
```

**Validation Mechanisms**:
- **Real-time Checking**: Balance integrity verified on every transaction
- **Dashboard Alerts**: Home screen displays warnings when discrepancies detected
- **Unallocated Balance Tracking**: System calculates and displays unallocated amounts
- **Transaction Blocking**: Critical operations may be blocked until balance integrity restored

### Wallet Management Rules

**Naming Constraints**:
- Wallet names must be unique within a user's account (case-insensitive)
- Names cannot be blank or contain only whitespace
- Maximum length restrictions for display consistency

**Currency Consistency**:
- Physical form must match supported currency type
- Currency cannot be changed after wallet creation (data integrity)
- All transactions maintain native currency precision

**Type Immutability**:
- Wallet type (Physical/Logical) cannot be changed after creation
- Ensures consistent categorization throughout wallet lifecycle
- Prevents accidental miscategorization of financial data

## Multi-Currency Support

### Currency Display Modes

**Native Currency Display**:
- Each wallet displays amounts in its original currency
- Preserves exact precision and formatting
- Ideal for detailed wallet management

**Converted Currency Display**:
- Amounts converted to user's default currency
- Enables portfolio aggregation and comparison
- Uses current conversion rates with fallback mechanisms

### Conversion Rate Integration

**Rate Resolution Hierarchy**:
1. **Monthly Rates**: Time-specific rates take highest precedence
2. **Default Rates**: Permanent rates used when monthly unavailable
3. **Inverse Calculation**: System computes reverse rates automatically
4. **Warning System**: Alerts when no conversion rates available

**Home Screen Aggregation**:
- All wallet balances converted to default currency for total portfolio value
- Missing conversion rates trigger user warnings
- Maintains accuracy through proper rate management
