There are 2 kinds of wallets, the physical one and the logical one. Physical wallets are wallets 
that represent real wallets in the physical world. For example like bank account wallet, cash wallet
or crypto wallet. And then logical wallets are wallets that logically created on top of physical 
wallets. For example, let's say I have 2 physical wallets, one in DBS bank and another one on CIMB
bank. In total I have 3000 USD. On top of these physical wallets, I created 3 logical wallets. The
first one is my monthly expense wallet containing 800 USD. The second one is my emergency fund 
wallet, containing 1000 USD, and the last one is my saving wallet containing the rest of the fund.
Each wallet also have currency.
