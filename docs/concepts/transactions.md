There are 3 types of transactions. 
1. Transaction that increase a wallet balance.
2. Transaction that decrease a wallet balance.
3. A transaction that move balance from one wallet to another.

For the first and second transaction types, user must select which physical and logical wallets 
that will be increased or decreased. User also can define specific transaction tags, otherwise it
will be automatically tagged as "Untagged"

For the third balance transaction, user may select whether he want to move balance between physical 
or logical wallets, and then he need to choose the source wallet and destination wallet. The source
and destination wallets must have the same currency and wallet type.

Each transaction has transaction date.
