# Profiteer Transaction System Documentation

## Overview

Profiteer implements a comprehensive transaction system that manages all financial movements within the application. The system supports three distinct transaction types with sophisticated validation, multi-wallet support, and advanced categorization through a unified tagging system.

## Transaction Architecture

### Transaction Type Classifications

**1. Income Transactions (`TransactionType.INCOME`)**

**Purpose**: Record money entering the user's financial ecosystem from external sources.

**Behavior**:
- Increases balances in selected wallets
- Affects exactly one Physical wallet and one Logical wallet simultaneously
- Enables proper tracking of money sources and budget allocation

**Examples**:
- Salary deposits from employers
- Investment returns and dividends
- Gifts and monetary presents received
- Refunds from purchases or services
- Freelance income and side business earnings
- Government benefits and tax refunds

**Validation Requirements**:
- Positive transaction amount (> 0)
- Exactly one Physical wallet selection
- Exactly one Logical wallet selection
- Valid transaction date (cannot be future-dated)
- Both wallets must belong to authenticated user

**2. Expense Transactions (`TransactionType.EXPENSE`)**

**Purpose**: Record money leaving the user's financial ecosystem for external purchases or payments.

**Behavior**:
- Decreases balances in selected wallets
- Affects exactly one Physical wallet and one Logical wallet simultaneously  
- Tracks spending against both actual accounts and budget categories

**Examples**:
- Food purchases and dining expenses
- Utility bills and subscription services
- Entertainment and leisure activities
- Transportation costs (fuel, public transit, rideshares)
- Healthcare expenses and insurance premiums
- Shopping and personal purchases

**Validation Requirements**:
- Positive transaction amount (> 0)
- Exactly one Physical wallet selection  
- Exactly one Logical wallet selection
- Sufficient balance validation (optional, can be disabled)
- Valid transaction date (cannot be future-dated)

**3. Transfer Transactions (`TransactionType.TRANSFER`)**

**Purpose**: Move money between different wallets within the user's financial system.

**Behavior**:
- Zero-sum operation: decreases source wallet, increases destination wallet
- Maintains total portfolio balance while redistributing funds
- Enables rebalancing between accounts or budget categories

**Examples**:
- Moving money between bank accounts
- Transferring funds to savings accounts
- Reallocating budget between logical categories
- Moving investment funds between different accounts
- Consolidating accounts or redistributing cash flow

**Critical Validation Requirements**:
- Source and destination wallets must have identical currency
- Source and destination must be same wallet type (Physical OR Logical)
- Source and destination cannot be the same wallet
- Positive transfer amount (> 0)
- Source wallet must have sufficient balance (when validation enabled)

## Transaction Data Model

### Current Implementation

```kotlin
data class Transaction(
    val id: String = "",                          // Firestore document ID
    val title: String = "",                       // User-provided description
    val amount: Double = 0.0,                     // Always positive amount
    val category: String = "Untagged",            // Legacy field for backward compatibility
    val type: TransactionType = TransactionType.EXPENSE, // INCOME, EXPENSE, TRANSFER
    val walletId: String = "",                    // Legacy single wallet reference
    val affectedWalletIds: List<String> = emptyList(), // Modern multi-wallet system
    val sourceWalletId: String = "",              // Transfer source wallet
    val destinationWalletId: String = "",         // Transfer destination wallet
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList(),         // Current tagging system
    val transactionDate: Date? = null,            // User-specified transaction date
    val userId: String = "",                      // Owner reference
    val createdAt: Date? = null,                  // System creation timestamp
    val updatedAt: Date? = null                   // Last modification timestamp
)

enum class TransactionType {
    INCOME, EXPENSE, TRANSFER
}
```

### Field Evolution & Compatibility

**Legacy Fields (Maintained for Backward Compatibility)**:
- **`category`**: Single category field replaced by multi-tag system
- **`walletId`**: Single wallet reference superseded by `affectedWalletIds`

**Modern Fields (Current Implementation)**:
- **`affectedWalletIds`**: Array containing exactly two wallet IDs for Income/Expense transactions
- **`tags`**: Multiple tags per transaction replacing single category
- **`sourceWalletId` / `destinationWalletId`**: Direct wallet-to-wallet references for transfers
- **`transactionDate`**: User-specified date that can differ from `createdAt`

## Advanced Tagging System

### Tag Implementation Architecture

**Unified Tagging Approach**:
Profiteer implements a sophisticated tagging system that replaces traditional categories with flexible, multi-dimensional classification.

**Key Features**:
- **Multiple Tags Per Transaction**: Each transaction can have unlimited descriptive tags
- **Historical Auto-completion**: System learns from previous transactions
- **Case-Sensitive Precision**: Tags maintain exact case for precise categorization
- **Default Behavior**: Transactions without tags display as "Untagged"

### Smart Auto-completion System

**Trigger Mechanism**:
- Activates after typing 3 or more characters
- Searches through all historical tags from user's transactions
- Returns up to 5 most relevant suggestions

**Matching Algorithm**:
- **Contains Matching**: Finds tags containing the typed substring
- **Frequency Weighting**: Prioritizes commonly used tags
- **Recency Bonus**: Recent tags receive higher priority
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: Matches regardless of capitalization

**Example Tag Usage**:
```
Transaction: "Lunch at Italian Restaurant"
Tags: ["Food", "Restaurant", "Italian", "Business Lunch", "Downtown"]

Transaction: "Monthly Phone Bill Payment"  
Tags: ["Utilities", "Phone", "Monthly", "Recurring"]

Transaction: "Emergency Car Repair"
Tags: ["Transportation", "Emergency", "Auto Maintenance", "Unexpected"]
```

### Tag Display & Management

**User Interface Integration**:
- **Input Field**: Text field with real-time auto-completion dropdown
- **Tag Visualization**: Tags displayed as comma-separated list in transaction views
- **Editing Support**: Full tag modification capabilities in transaction editing
- **Search Integration**: Tag-based filtering in transaction lists

**Historical Tag Persistence**:
- All previously used tags maintained in user's tag history
- No separate tag management collection required
- Automatic cleanup of unused tags (future enhancement)

## Wallet Balance Management

### Multi-Wallet Transaction Processing

**Income/Expense Transaction Flow**:
1. **Validation**: Verify wallet ownership and business rules
2. **Balance Calculation**: Determine impact on each selected wallet  
3. **Atomic Update**: Modify both Physical and Logical wallet balances simultaneously
4. **Integrity Check**: Verify overall balance integrity maintained
5. **Audit Trail**: Record complete transaction history

**Transfer Transaction Flow**:
1. **Pre-validation**: Verify currency and type matching requirements
2. **Balance Check**: Confirm sufficient funds in source wallet
3. **Zero-Sum Operation**: Decrease source by amount, increase destination by same amount
4. **Consistency Verification**: Ensure total portfolio balance unchanged
5. **Transaction Recording**: Log complete transfer details

### Balance Integrity Enforcement

**Critical Business Rules**:
- **Portfolio Consistency**: Total balance across all wallets must remain mathematically consistent
- **Real-time Validation**: Balance integrity checked on every transaction operation
