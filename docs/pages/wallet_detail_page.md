Wallet detail page shows the following information:
- Balance of the wallet.
- Sum of debit and credit in this month.
- List of transactions affecting the wallet in the descending order of the transaction date.

By default we show the amounts in the default currency, but if the wallet is actually on another
currency, we can also toggle it.
