# Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Template

## 1. Overview
**Brief Description**: Fix visual bug in transaction datepicker where the last column (Saturday) is too narrow compared to other weekday columns, causing poor visual balance and potential usability issues

**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Complexity**: Low-Medium

**Expected Development Time**: 1-2 days

## 2. Context & Background
**Current State**: 
- Transaction create and edit screens use `TransactionDatePickerDialog` with Material 3's `DatePicker` component
- The datepicker displays a calendar grid with weekday columns (Sunday through Saturday)
- The last column (Saturday) appears visually narrower than other weekday columns
- This creates visual imbalance and may affect user experience, especially for Saturday date selection

**Problem Statement**: The datepicker calendar grid has inconsistent column widths, with the Saturday column being noticeably narrower than other weekday columns. This visual inconsistency creates an unpolished appearance and potentially makes Saturday dates harder to tap on mobile devices.

**User Impact**: Users selecting dates that fall on Saturday may experience:
- Reduced tap target size making selection more difficult
- Visual confusion due to asymmetrical layout
- Overall perception of poor UI quality
- Potential accessibility issues for users with motor impairments

**Business Value**: Fixing this visual bug will improve the overall user experience, maintain professional app appearance, and ensure consistent usability across all weekdays.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
**Core Features**:
- [ ] Ensure all weekday columns in datepicker have equal width
- [ ] Maintain proper spacing and padding for all date cells
- [ ] Preserve existing datepicker functionality (selection, navigation, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure fix works across different screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Maintain Material 3 design consistency
- [ ] Verify fix applies to both create and edit transaction screens

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want all weekday columns in the datepicker to have equal width so that the calendar appears balanced and professional
- As a user, I want Saturday dates to be as easy to select as any other weekday date
- As a user with motor impairments, I want consistent tap target sizes across all calendar dates
- As a user, I want the datepicker to look polished and well-designed across different devices

**Business Logic**:
- **Column Width Calculation**: All 7 weekday columns should have equal width (1/7 of available width)
- **Responsive Design**: Column widths should adapt properly to different screen sizes
- **Touch Target Size**: Each date cell should meet minimum touch target requirements (48dp)
- **Spacing Consistency**: Uniform padding and margins across all date cells
- **Material 3 Compliance**: Maintain adherence to Material 3 design specifications

### 3.2 Technical Requirements
**Architecture Considerations**:
- Fix should be applied to the `TransactionDatePickerDialog` composable in CreateTransactionScreen.kt
- Solution should work with Material 3's `DatePicker` component
- May require custom styling or layout modifications
- Should not break existing date selection functionality
- Must maintain compatibility with different Android API levels

**Data Requirements**:
- No changes to date handling or storage logic required
- Focus purely on visual/layout improvements
- Maintain existing date format and selection behavior

**API Requirements**:
- No new APIs required - purely UI/layout fix
- May need to explore Material 3 DatePicker styling options
- Could require custom layout implementations if Material 3 styling is insufficient

### 3.3 UI/UX Requirements
**Design Specifications**:
- **Column Width**: All 7 weekday columns must have exactly equal width
- **Cell Sizing**: Each date cell should have consistent dimensions
- **Spacing**: Uniform horizontal and vertical spacing between cells
- **Alignment**: Proper center alignment of day numbers and weekday headers
- **Visual Balance**: Symmetrical appearance across the entire calendar grid

**Interaction Design**:
- **Touch Targets**: Maintain minimum 48dp touch target size for all date cells
- **Visual Feedback**: Consistent hover/press states across all columns
- **Selection Indicator**: Uniform selection highlighting regardless of weekday
- **Navigation**: Proper month navigation without layout shifts

**Accessibility**:
- Consistent touch target sizes for motor accessibility
- Proper screen reader support for all date cells
- High contrast compliance maintained across all columns
- Keyboard navigation support preserved

## 4. Implementation Guidance

### 4.1 Root Cause Analysis
**Potential Causes**:
1. **Material 3 Default Styling**: The default `DatePicker` component may have built-in styling issues
2. **Container Width Calculation**: The parent container might not be distributing width evenly
3. **Padding/Margin Inconsistencies**: Different padding applied to edge columns
4. **Screen Size Dependencies**: Layout calculation errors on specific screen dimensions
5. **RTL/LTR Layout Issues**: Right-to-left layout considerations affecting last column

### 4.2 Suggested Approach
**Phase 1**: Investigation and Diagnosis
- [ ] Create test cases to reproduce the visual bug across different devices
- [ ] Analyze Material 3 `DatePicker` source code and styling options
- [ ] Identify specific CSS/styling properties causing the width discrepancy
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes and orientations to understand scope

**Phase 2**: Solution Implementation
**Option A: Material 3 Styling Override**
- [ ] Use Material 3's theming system to override column width calculations
- [ ] Apply custom `DatePickerDefaults` or theme modifications
- [ ] Ensure solution is compatible with Material 3 updates

**Option B: Custom Layout Implementation**
- [ ] Create custom calendar grid layout if Material 3 styling is insufficient
- [ ] Implement equal-width column distribution algorithm
- [ ] Maintain Material 3 visual appearance and behavior
- [ ] Ensure accessibility features are preserved

**Option C: Container Modifications**
- [ ] Modify the container layout of `TransactionDatePickerDialog`
- [ ] Apply specific width constraints to ensure proper distribution
- [ ] Use `fillMaxWidth()` and weight distribution appropriately

**Phase 3**: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test fix across multiple device sizes (phones, tablets)
- [ ] Verify both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Test on different Android API levels
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance
- [ ] Perform visual regression testing

### 4.3 Files to Focus On
