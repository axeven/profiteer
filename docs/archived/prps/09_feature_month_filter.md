# Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Template

## 1. Overview
**Brief Description**: Add month filtering functionality to wallet detail page transaction list allowing users to view transactions from specific months and years

**Priority**: Medium

**Estimated Complexity**: Medium

**Expected Development Time**: 2-3 days

## 2. Context & Background
**Current State**: 
- Wallet detail page shows ALL transactions for a wallet in chronological order (most recent first)
- Monthly summary calculations are fixed to current month only
- Users cannot filter transactions by specific time periods
- Long transaction history makes it difficult to find transactions from specific months
- No way to view historical monthly summaries for budget analysis

**Problem Statement**: Users with extensive transaction history need to scroll through potentially hundreds of transactions to find activity from specific months. There's no way to focus on a particular month's activity or compare monthly performance over time, making historical financial analysis and budget tracking difficult.

**User Impact**: Users managing active wallets over months/years will benefit from being able to quickly filter to specific months, analyze historical spending patterns, and track month-over-month financial performance for better budgeting and financial planning.

**Business Value**: Enhanced user experience for long-term users, improved engagement through better financial insights, and foundation for advanced analytics features like spending trends and budget comparisons.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
**Core Features**:
- [ ] Add month/year selector UI component above transaction list
- [ ] Filter transaction list to show only transactions from selected month/year
- [ ] Update monthly summary calculations to reflect selected month instead of current month
- [ ] Provide easy navigation between consecutive months (Previous/Next buttons)
- [ ] Default to current month on initial load
- [ ] Persist selected month during wallet detail session
- [ ] Show transaction count for selected month
- [ ] Handle months with no transactions gracefully
- [ ] Support date range spanning multiple years (e.g., 2023-2025)

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to select a specific month/year so that I can view only transactions from that period
- As a user, I want to see updated monthly income/expense summaries for the selected month so that I can analyze historical performance
- As a user, I want Previous/Next navigation so that I can easily move between consecutive months
- As a user, I want the filter to default to the current month so that I see relevant recent activity
- As a user, I want to see a transaction count indicator so that I know how many transactions exist for the selected period
- As a user, I want empty months to show appropriate messaging so that I understand when no activity occurred

**Business Logic**:
- **Date Filtering**: Filter transactions based on `transactionDate` field (fallback to `createdAt` if null)
- **Month Boundary Logic**: Include transactions from start of month (00:00:00) to end of month (23:59:59)
- **Monthly Summary Recalculation**: 
  - Recalculate income/expense totals for selected month
  - Include transfer transaction impacts based on wallet role (using existing logic)
  - Apply currency conversion for accurate cross-currency aggregation
- **Navigation Logic**:
  - Previous/Next buttons navigate by calendar month
  - Handle year transitions properly (Dec 2023 → Jan 2024)
  - Disable Previous button if no earlier transactions exist
  - Disable Next button if future month selected
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering on client-side for reasonable transaction volumes
- **State Management**: Maintain selected month state during wallet detail session
