## Core Domain Model

### Advanced Wallet System Architecture
Profiteer implements a sophisticated dual-wallet system that separates real-world financial accounts from virtual budget allocations:

**Physical Wallets**
- Represent tangible financial accounts (bank accounts, cash, cryptocurrency wallets)
- Each operates in its native currency with independent balance tracking
- Support multiple physical forms via `PhysicalForm` enum:
  - `FIAT_CURRENCY`: Traditional currencies (USD, EUR, IDR)
  - `PRECIOUS_METAL`: Gold with gram-based pricing
  - `CRYPTOCURRENCY`: Bitcoin with 8-decimal precision
- Direct transaction impacts with real-time balance updates
- Serve as the foundation for all financial operations

**Logical Wallets**
- Virtual categorizations for budgeting and allocation purposes
- Examples: "Monthly Expenses", "Emergency Fund", "Vacation Savings"
- Reference physical wallets through the `affectedWalletIds` system
- **Business Rule**: Total logical wallet balances must equal total physical wallet balances
- Enable sophisticated budgeting without affecting underlying physical accounts
- Support unallocated balance tracking for better financial oversight

### Transaction System Architecture
Profiteer supports three distinct transaction types with comprehensive validation and business logic:

1. **Income Transactions (`TransactionType.INCOME`)**
   - Add money to wallets (salary, deposits, gifts)
   - Affects both one Physical and one Logical wallet simultaneously
   - Increases wallet balances and updates transaction-based analytics
   - Required fields: target wallets, positive amount, optional tags

2. **Expense Transactions (`TransactionType.EXPENSE`)**
   - Remove money from wallets (purchases, bills, withdrawals)
   - Affects both one Physical and one Logical wallet simultaneously
   - Decreases wallet balances and tracks spending patterns
   - Required fields: source wallets, positive amount, optional tags

3. **Transfer Transactions (`TransactionType.TRANSFER`)**
   - Move money between wallets of the same type and currency
   - Implements zero-sum accounting (source decreases, destination increases)
   - **Critical Validation**: Source and destination must have same currency AND wallet type
   - Required fields: source wallet, destination wallet, positive amount
   - Optional: transfer description and categorization tags

### Multi-Currency Architecture
Profiteer implements a sophisticated multi-currency system supporting diverse financial instruments:

**Supported Currency Types**
- **Standard Currencies**: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, IDR
- **Precious Metals**: GOLD (gram-based pricing with 3-decimal precision)
- **Cryptocurrency**: BTC (8-decimal precision for satoshi-level accuracy)

**Currency Conversion System**
- **Default Currency**: User-configurable base currency for aggregated displays
- **Native Currency Operations**: Each wallet maintains its original currency
- **Dual Rate System**:
  - **Default Rates**: Permanent conversion rates for consistent long-term calculations
  - **Monthly Rates**: Time-specific rates for accurate historical conversions
- **Smart Rate Resolution**: Monthly rates take precedence over default rates when available
- **Bi-directional Conversion**: Automatic inverse rate calculation when direct rates unavailable
- **Missing Rate Warnings**: User alerts when conversion rates needed for accurate balance aggregation

**Display Flexibility**
- Home screen aggregation converts all balances to default currency
- Individual wallet views support native currency or converted currency display
- Transaction displays preserve original currency while showing converted amounts
- Currency-specific formatting with appropriate decimal precision

### Advanced Transaction Categorization
Profiteer implements a unified tagging system that replaced the traditional category approach:

**Tag-Based System**
- **Multiple Tags per Transaction**: Each transaction can have multiple descriptive tags
- **Unified Category/Tag Model**: Merged traditional categories and tags into a single flexible system
- **Smart Auto-completion**: Historical tag suggestions appear after typing 3+ characters
- **Default Behavior**: Transactions without explicit tags receive "Untagged" designation
- **Tag Persistence**: System remembers all previously used tags for future auto-completion

**Analytics Integration**
- Tags enable sophisticated filtering and grouping for financial analytics
- Support complex queries combining time range, wallet, and tag filters
- Monthly expense categorization based on tag frequency and amounts
- Transaction search and filtering across all tag dimensions

**Backward Compatibility**
- Legacy transactions with `category` field maintain compatibility
- Gradual migration from categories to tags without data loss
- Existing category data preserved while enabling new tag functionality

- **Transaction Impact**: All transactions must affect both physical and logical wallets simultaneously
- **Unallocated Balance Tracking**: System tracks and displays unallocated physical wallet balance

### Enhanced Transaction Validation
- **Amount Validation**: All transaction amounts must be positive numbers (> 0)
- **Transfer Constraints**: 
  - Source and destination wallets must have identical currency
  - Source and destination must be the same wallet type (Physical or Logical)
  - Cannot transfer from a wallet to itself
- **Wallet Selection Validation**:
  - Income/Expense transactions require exactly one Physical and one Logical wallet
  - Transfer transactions require source and destination of same type
- **Tag Validation**: Multiple tags supported, "Untagged" default for empty tag lists
- **Date Validation**: Transaction dates cannot be in the future

### Multi-Currency Conversion Rules
- **Rate Hierarchy**: Monthly rates override default rates when available
- **Bi-directional Conversion**: System calculates inverse rates when direct rates unavailable
- **Non-destructive Display**: Original transaction currencies always preserved
- **Rate Fallback System**: Default → Monthly → Warning when no rates available
- **Precision Control**: Currency-specific decimal precision (BTC: 8, GOLD: 3, Fiat: 2)

### Data Validation & Integrity
- **User Data Isolation**: Strict enforcement through Firestore security rules
- **Document Consistency**: Firestore transactions ensure atomic operations
